# C-Pointers-Sorting-

This simple code reads in a file that can be specified with any number of whitespace whether they be trailing or leading, or in bvetween
The first line tells the size of the next line's array
The second line are the elements in the array

The code then intializes an array with these elements and displays the sorted order of the array

The purpose is to practice with pointers and sorting (bubble sort in this case)
